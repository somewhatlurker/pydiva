fontmap reversing work by myself and SuzukiKennji#6585

header:
0x00: "FMH3" magic
0x04: padding (0x00 x4)
0x08: number of fonts
0x0c: pointer to font pointers

font pointers:
1x 32 bit address per font

font:
0x00: map id
0x04: character advance width (byte) -- note: size metrics are overridden by the game
0x05: character line height (byte)
0x06: glyph box width (size of character in texture) (byte)
0x07: glyph box height (size of character in texture) (byte)
0x08: offset 0x38 in TLAC Drawing RawFont -- unknown use (looks like only second lowest bit matters?)
0x09: offset 0x08 in TLAC Drawing RawFont -- defines a fraction with next byte (seems to change startup screen margins)
0x0a: offset 0x09 in TLAC Drawing RawFont
0x0b: padding
0x0c: ???? (seems to be 4x 0x00, possibly more params)
0x10: number of characters per row (not used by the game?)
0x14: number of characters
0x18: pointer to characters

character:
0x00: unicode character id (16 bit)
0x02: 0x01 if halfwidth (or variable width?) else 0x00
0x03: padding
0x04: texture column
0x05: texture row
0x06: kern? (position of glypth in box)
0x07: glypth width
